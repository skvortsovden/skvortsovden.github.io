title: "Kubernetes Pod-to-Pod Communication: Deep Dive"
categories: kubernetes

[In the previous post](https://skvortsovden.github.io/posts/2022-10-28-kubernetes-pod-to-pod-communication/), I provided a basic overview of how communication between pods works in Kubernetes. We explored how to deploy applications and check their connectivity using `curl`. However, there are many more aspects to consider when it comes to pod-to-pod communication.

In this post, I'll take a deeper look into how communication between pods works in Kubernetes, focusing on the underlying mechanisms and configurations that enable seamless interaction.
