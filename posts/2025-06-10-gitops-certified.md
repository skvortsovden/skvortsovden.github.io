So, what does that mean?

I passed the CGOA certification last weekend, and I only prepared for one day.

## Why did I decide to take the exam?
I saw a sale on the Linux Foundation website and thought it was a great chance to learn something new.

GitOps wasn’t really on my radar, but I wanted to test my knowledge since I’ve been working as a DevOps engineer for nine years and every year, a new buzzword pops up.

## Preparation

To prepare, I read a few articles, made a mind map based on the Domains & Competencies list, and took three mock exams on Udemy.
It turned out I already knew most of the concepts and patterns. It was mostly about getting used to the terminology.

## Sum-up

Overall, I recommend this certification, especially if you can get it on sale.
- If you're new to DevOps, it’s a great place to start.
- If you're experienced, it’s a good way to check your knowledge and (maybe) learn something new.
