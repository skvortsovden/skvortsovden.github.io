First thing first, there is **no** such object as a **user in Kubernetes**.  
**Certificates** are used for authentification and authorization.

So **a user** in Kubernetes is represented as **a certificate owner**.

In order **to give access for a user** (certificate owner) to your cluster a user's **certificate should be signed** by the certificate authority that your cluster trust.

A few steps are required in order to get a normal user to be able to authenticate and invoke an API. First, this user must have a certificate issued by the Kubernetes cluster, and then present that certificate to the Kubernetes API.
