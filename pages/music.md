I love music.  
I listen to it every day.  
I listen to music while I work, while I walk, while I run, while I drive, and while I do almost everything else.  

Here are some of my favorite songs and albums.  
I will update this list from time to time.

## The Stone Roses - Fools Gold

> I heard this song in one of the episodes of Black Mirror. It's from the late '80s. I like how the guitar sounds here.

## The Lazy Jesus - Grunt

> The Lazy Jesus is a Ukrainian sound producer, DJ and musician. 
I love this song for its tribal vibe and the way it makes me want to move.

## Katarsis - VasarÄ… galvoj minoras

> First time I heard this band in 2025 at Eurovision.  
I listened to this song on repeat for a week.  
Although I don't understand it, I love the Lithuanian language and the way it sounds in this song.

## Nicolas Jaar - Mi Mujer

> Back in 2010 when I was just a student, I heard this song somewhere.  
I didn't know who the artist was, but I loved it.  
It turned out to be Nicolas Jaar - well known artist.
