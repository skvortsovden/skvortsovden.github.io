    <h1>Hosting personal website on Google Cloud</h1>
    <p>I have <a href="https://skvortsovden.github.io/">this website</a> hosted on GitHub Pages, but I decided to learn how to work with GCP, GitHub Actions, and Terraform.</p>
<p>So, here we go!</p>
<p>The official documentation on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hosting-static-website">How to host a static website on GCP</a> is great.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will omit the steps to create a GCP account and set up billing because they're boring.
I'll focus on the high-level steps with some code snippets to illustrate the process.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Diagram</h2>
<p>The diagram below shows the components I use and their relationships.</p>
<p><img src="/img/static-personal-website.svg" alt="Screenshot"></p>
<h2>Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</h2>
<p>GCP has <strong>a free tier</strong> that allows you to host a static website for free.
See: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/free-cloud-features#storage">https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/free-cloud-features#storage</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Free Tier is only available in us-east1, us-west1, and us-central1 regions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>GCP is organized into <strong>projects</strong>. Each project has its own resources, billing, and permissions.</p>
<p>So, the <strong>first step is to create a project</strong>.</p>
<p>I am using the gcloud CLI to create the project.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">gcloud projects create pp-ua-site-project
</code></pre>
<p>Although I prefer using the CLI over the web console (old school), there is an even better approach: following <strong>IaC (Infrastructure as Code)</strong> principles.
So, I will use Terraform to create the project and all the resources.</p>
<h2>Terraform</h2>
<p>Let's lay the groundwork for our infrastructure.</p>
<p>Here's the bare minimum Terraform configuration to get started.</p>
<p>I'll start with the <strong>vars.tf</strong> file.</p>
<p>Define variables for:</p>
<ul>
<li>project name (the one that is created in GCP)</li>
<li>region (the one that is free tier eligible)</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-hcl"># terraform/vars.tf

variable &quot;region&quot; {
  description = &quot;The GCP region to deploy resources in&quot;
  type        = string
  default     = &quot;us-east-1&quot;
}
variable &quot;project_name&quot; {
  description = &quot;Name of the project&quot;
  type        = string
  default     = &quot;pp-ua-site-project&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now, let's create the <strong>main.tf</strong> configuration file.
Terraform automatically reads variables from the file if you name it <code>vars.tf</code> and put it in the same directory as <code>main.tf</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-hcl"># terraform/main.tf
terraform {
  required_providers {
    google = {
      source  = &quot;hashicorp/google&quot;
      version = &quot;~&gt; 3.5&quot;
    }
  }
}
provider &quot;google&quot; {
  project = var.project_name
  region  = var.region
}

resource &quot;google_project&quot; &quot;website_project&quot; {
  name       = var.project_name
  project_id = var.project_name
}
</code></pre>
<p>The variables are referenced using the <code>var.&lt;variable_name&gt;</code> syntax.</p>
<p>Let's terraform the ground.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the resource is already created using the CLI or web UI, you can import it into the Terraform state using the <code>terraform import</code> command.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># command
terraform import google_project.website_project projects/pp-ua-site-project
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># output
google_project.website_project: Importing from ID &quot;projects/pp-ua-site-project&quot;...
google_project.website_project: Import prepared!
  Prepared google_project for import
google_project.website_project: Refreshing state... [id=projects/pp-ua-site-project]

Import successful!

The resources that were imported are shown above. These resources are now in
your Terraform state and will henceforth be managed by Terraform.
</code></pre>
<p>Nice, my local Terraform is synced with the remote GCP resources.</p>
<p>Now, when I run <code>terraform apply</code>, it will not create a new project, but will update the existing one.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># output
google_project.website_project: Refreshing state... [id=projects/pp-ua-site-project]

No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.

Terraform has compared your real infrastructure against your configuration and found no differences, so no changes are needed.

Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
</code></pre>
<p>At this point, we have a project created in GCP.</p>
<h2>GCP Cloud Storage</h2>
<p>I use <strong>Cloud Storage to store static files</strong> (HTML, CSS, JS, images).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cloud Storage is a service for storing your <strong>objects</strong> in Google Cloud. An object is an immutable piece of data consisting of a file of any format. You store objects in containers called <strong>buckets</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Source: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/introduction">https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/introduction</a></p>
<p>The free tier allows you to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/free-cloud-features#storage">store up to 5GB</a> of data in Cloud Storage.</p>
<p>I believe my website should fit within this limit :)</p>
<p>Add the bucket resource to the <code>main.tf</code> file.</p>
<pre><code class="language-hcl"># terraform/main.tf
resource &quot;google_storage_bucket&quot; &quot;website_bucket&quot; {
  name     = var.bucket_name
  location = var.location
  website {
    main_page_suffix = &quot;index.html&quot;
    not_found_page   = &quot;404.html&quot;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># terraform apply
The billing account for the owning project is disabled in state absent, accountDisabled
</code></pre>
<p>Oops. I need to enable billing for the project.
I had to go to the GCP console and enable billing for the project.
I just didn't want to create another billing account, so I used the existing one.</p>
<p>Let's try <code>terraform apply</code> again.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># output
google_project.website_project: Modifying... [id=projects/pp-ua-site-project]
google_storage_bucket.website_bucket: Creating...
google_storage_bucket.website_bucket: Creation complete after 1s [id=pp-ua-site-bucket]
google_project.website_project: Modifications complete after 3s [id=projects/pp-ua-site-project]

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 1 changed, 0 destroyed.
</code></pre>
<p>Cool. Now we have a container (bucket) to store our static files.</p>
<h2>GitHub Actions</h2>
<p>The next step is to upload files to the bucket.
I have my static files stored in the GitHub repository.
So, first I have to create a <strong>CI/CD pipeline</strong> to upload files to the bucket.</p>
<p>I will use <strong>GitHub Actions</strong> to do that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. You can create workflows that run tests whenever you push a change to your repository, or that deploy merged pull requests to production.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Source: <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/quickstart">https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/quickstart</a></p>
<p>There are templates available for GitHub Actions, but <strong>I can't find one for Cloud Storage/Bucket</strong>.</p>
<p>Templates: <a href="https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/tree/main/deployments">https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/tree/main/deployments</a></p>
<p>So, <strong>I will create a custom workflow</strong> to upload files to the bucket.</p>
<h3>Pipeline</h3>
<p>Let's break down the pipeline into steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Checkout the files from the repository</li>
<li>Authenticate to GCP</li>
<li>Upload files to the GCP bucket</li>
</ol>
<p>Using <strong>existing actions</strong> for each step to simplify the workflow:</p>
<ol>
<li>https://github.com/actions/checkout</li>
<li>https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth</li>
<li>https://github.com/google-github-actions/upload-cloud-storage</li>
</ol>
<p>The <strong>pipeline should be triggered</strong> every time I <strong>push my changes</strong> to the main branch.</p>
<p>Let's create a new file in the <code>.github/workflows</code> directory.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml"># .github/workflows/gcp-bucket-deployment.yaml
name: Deploy to Google Cloud Storage

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    # Any runner supporting Node 20 or newer
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: gcp

    # Add &quot;id-token&quot; with the intended permissions.
    permissions:
      contents: 'read'
      id-token: 'write'

    steps:
    - id: 'checkout'
      uses: 'actions/checkout@v4'

    - id: 'gcp_auth'
      uses: 'google-github-actions/auth@v2'
      with:
        project_id: '$'
        credentials_json: '$'

    - id: 'gcp_upload_file'
      uses: 'google-github-actions/upload-cloud-storage@v2'
      with:
        path: 'docs'
        destination: $
</code></pre>
<h2>GCP Service Account</h2>
<p>To make it work, I need to create a <strong>service account</strong> in GCP and give it permissions to upload files to the bucket.</p>
<p>I don't want to use my personal account credentials anywhere except my local machine.</p>
<p>I'll create a <strong>service account</strong> for GitHub.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A service account is a special kind of account typically used by an application or compute workload, such as a Compute Engine instance, rather than a person. A service account is identified by its email address, which is unique to the account.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Source: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-overview">https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-overview</a></p>
<h2>GCP Identity and Access Management (IAM)</h2>
<p>Now I have to make sure the service account has only read/write access to my bucket.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>IAM</strong> allows you to control <strong>who has access to the resources</strong> in your Google Cloud project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will use <strong>Terraform</strong> to create the service account and give it permissions.</p>
<p>To find out the role to use for the service account, see:
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/iam-roles">https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/iam-roles</a></p>
<p>The role <strong>Storage Object User (roles/storage.objectUser)</strong> looks like a good role to use for the service account.</p>
<pre><code class="language-hcl"># terraform/main.tf
resource &quot;google_service_account&quot; &quot;website_service_account&quot; {
  account_id   = &quot;website-service-account&quot;
  display_name = &quot;Website Service Account&quot;
  project      = google_project.website_project.project_id
}
resource &quot;google_storage_bucket_iam_member&quot; &quot;website_bucket_iam_member&quot; {
  bucket = google_storage_bucket.website_bucket.name
  role   = &quot;roles/storage.objectUser&quot;
  member = &quot;serviceAccount:${google_service_account.website_service_account.email}&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>GCP_SA_KEY</strong> – see how to create/get a key for your service account here:
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete#iam-service-account-keys-create-console">https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete#iam-service-account-keys-create-console</a></p>
<h2>Configuring GitHub</h2>
<p>Before adding the workflow to my repo, I need to configure environment variables in my repo.</p>
<p>In the GitHub repo, go to <strong>/settings/secrets/actions</strong>.</p>
<p>Create a new environment to store secrets for GCP.
I'll name it <code>gcp</code>.</p>
<p>Add the following environment secrets:</p>
<ul>
<li>GCP_PROJECT_ID</li>
<li>GCP_SA_KEY</li>
<li>GCS_BUCKET_NAME</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/img/scr02.png" alt="Screenshot"></p>
<h2>Kick-off the Pipeline</h2>
<p>Add the file <a href=".github/workflows/gcp-bucket-deployment.yaml">.github/workflows/gcp-bucket-deployment.yaml</a> to git, commit, and push changes upstream.</p>
<p>It should kick off the pipeline.</p>
<p>Check the GitHub Actions page.</p>
<p>It works!</p>
<p>I have all my files uploaded to the GCP bucket now.</p>
<p><img src="/img/scr03.png" alt="Screenshot"></p>
<p>Cool. But <strong>how do I make it publicly available?</strong></p>
<p>Let's navigate to this page and steal the Terraform snippet:<br>
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hosting-static-website#terraform_1">https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hosting-static-website#terraform_1</a></p>
<pre><code class="language-hcl"># Make bucket public by granting allUsers storage.objectViewer access
resource &quot;google_storage_bucket_iam_member&quot; &quot;public_rule&quot; {
  bucket = google_storage_bucket.website_bucket.name
  role   = &quot;roles/storage.objectViewer&quot;
  member = &quot;allUsers&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>After making my files on the bucket accessible from the internet by link:
<a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/pp-ua-site-bucket/docs/index.html">https://storage.googleapis.com/pp-ua-site-bucket/docs/index.html</a></p>
<p>Next, I want to make it available by a short domain name.</p>
<h2>Connecting your domain to Cloud Storage</h2>
<p>For this exercise, I didn't want to spend any money, so I found a way to register a free domain name using the <strong>Ukrainian hosting provider</strong> <a href="https://nic.ua/">nic.ua</a>.</p>
<p>You can register a <code>.pp.ua</code> domain name <strong>for free!</strong></p>
<p>Once that's done, I need to point my domain to the bucket.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To connect your domain to Cloud Storage, create a CNAME record through your domain registration service.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Source: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hosting-static-website-http#cname">https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hosting-static-website-http#cname</a></p>
<p>One more thing to make it work with my DNS and GCP bucket: I have to <strong>name my bucket the same as my domain name</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create a bucket whose name matches the CNAME you created for your domain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Source: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hosting-static-website-http#create-bucket">https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hosting-static-website-http#create-bucket</a></p>
<p>Eventually, my website became available at <a href="http://www.skvortsovden.pp.ua">http://www.skvortsovden.pp.ua</a></p>
<h2>Cloudflare</h2>
<p>Having my website accesible at <code>www</code> is ok, but I also want it to be accesible at root - <code>skvortsovden.pp.ua</code>.
Also, I'd like to have SSL enabled.</p>
<h3>What is Cloudflare?</h3>
<p>Cloudflare is a Content Delivery Network (<strong>CDN</strong>). It provides features to <strong>route and distribute traffic</strong> to your website, as well as secure connections via <strong>TLS/SSL</strong>.</p>
<p>read more: <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/what-is-cloudflare/">https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/what-is-cloudflare/</a></p>
<p>To make it work I just added two rules on Cloudflare:</p>
<ol>
<li>Redirect from root to www</li>
<li>Redirect from HTTP to HTTPS</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/img/scr04.png" alt="Screenshot"></p>
<p>Keep in mind that DNS propagation can take some time.<br>
Whenever you update or add DNS records, allow some time for the changes to take effect globally.</p>
<h2>Things I learned</h2>
<ul>
<li>A project is the top-level abstraction in GCP.</li>
<li>Each project must be linked to a billing account.</li>
<li>Terraform uses local state to track the status of resources in the cloud.</li>
<li>Terraform automatically detects variables from the <code>vars.tf</code> file located next to <code>main.tf</code>.</li>
<li>Service accounts and IAM roles work together to grant access and set permissions for external services like GitHub Actions.</li>
<li>DNS A records point to IP addresses, while CNAME records point to other DNS names.</li>
</ul>
