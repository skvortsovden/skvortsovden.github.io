    <h1>I&#39;m now a certified GitOps Associate</h1>
    <p>So, what does that mean?</p>
<p>I passed the CGOA certification last weekend, and I only prepared for one day.</p>
<h2>Why did I decide to take the exam?</h2>
<p>I saw a sale on the Linux Foundation website and thought it was a great chance to learn something new.</p>
<p>GitOps wasn’t really on my radar, but I wanted to test my knowledge since I’ve been working as a DevOps engineer for nine years and every year, a new buzzword pops up.</p>
<h2>Preparation</h2>
<p>To prepare, I read a few articles, made a mind map based on the Domains &amp; Competencies list, and took three mock exams on Udemy.
It turned out I already knew most of the concepts and patterns. It was mostly about getting used to the terminology.</p>
<h2>Sum-up</h2>
<p>Overall, I recommend this certification, especially if you can get it on sale.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you're new to DevOps, it’s a great place to start.</li>
<li>If you're experienced, it’s a good way to check your knowledge and (maybe) learn something new.</li>
</ul>
